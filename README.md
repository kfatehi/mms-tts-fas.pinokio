this is a [pinokio](https://github.com/pinokiocomputer/pinokio) package for [facebook/mms-tts-fas](https://huggingface.co/facebook/mms-tts-fas)

unfortunately i could not see a way to tell pinokio to just give me an interactive shell to the python app, but when you click start
you can see how it activates a shell and do that yourself in a command prompt and then go ahead and use it.

you'll need to install some more pip packages too, see app.py
