this is a [pinokio](https://github.com/pinokiocomputer/pinokio) package for [facebook/mms-tts-fas](https://huggingface.co/facebook/mms-tts-fas)

unfortunately i could not see a way to tell pinokio to just give me an interactive shell to the python app, but when you click start
you can see how it activates a shell and do that yourself in a command prompt and then go ahead and use it.

you'll need to install some more pip packages too, see app.py

pinokio tag removed because this is not high quality enough to want to show it in the discovery tab
